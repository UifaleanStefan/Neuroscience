# Latent Predictive Learning (LPL) Research Project

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for research on Latent Predictive Learning (LPL), a framework for learning predictive representations in neural networks.

## Project Structure

- **lpl_core/**: Core components including LPL layers, local predictors, and learning rule terms
- **training/**: Training scripts, configuration management, and sanity check utilities
- **experiments/**: Experiment runners for base experiments, ablation studies, and swap experiments
- **data/**: Dataset loaders and preprocessing for CIFAR, STL-10, and synthetic shapes
- **outputs/**: Directory for storing activations, weights, and training logs
